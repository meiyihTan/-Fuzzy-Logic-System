## Inference Engine 
Employing the Mamdani fuzzy inference system to do : 

1)Cheese Ripening Prediction
### Problem Statement
- Managing sensory properties from the fabrication stage in an automatic framework is challenging in food industries, especially in cheese manufacturing.
- Lack of knowledge on :
   - the complex interactions taking place between the whole microorganisms of the cheese.
   - the link between those interactions.
   - the kinetics of the sensory changes taking place in the cheese during ripening.
- Benefits:
   - Automated cheese manufacturing.
   - Cheese ripening estimation.


### Objective 
- To develop a model that is able to determine the ripening of cheese which follows the sensory trajectory of the cheese during ripening. 
- To help the expert in his daily task of estimation of the potential changes in of a cheese under given process conditions of air humidity and temperature.
- To inform an operator of the potential drift of the sensory change of the cheese at a given time t in order to help him to diagnose and control the process of cheese ripening.

2)Rain Prediction
### Problem Statement
- Flood is the most occured disaster in Malaysia.
- Being able to predict the rainfall volume enable the people to prepare and act
- Benefits:
   - Minimize loss of life and property
   - Weather Prediction

### Objective 
- To build a model that predicts the rainfall using fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence.
- To alert the public early for upcoming heavy rain.
- To inform the authorities of potential flooding to better handle the situation.
